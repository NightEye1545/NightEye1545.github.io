This is the first article published on my brand-new hub.  
The site is running on **GitHub Pages + Jekyll**, fully dark-themed, and ready to grow.  

Things I’ll be sharing here in the future:
- 🕹 Gaming highlights
- 💻 Coding projects
- ✍️ Articles on physics, dev, and life

Stay tuned — this is just the beginning.
